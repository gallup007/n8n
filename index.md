**_Disclaimer:_** _This is a basic template and may not be legally sufficient for all use cases or jurisdictions. It is intended for simple integrations, primarily posting content. If your workflow handles sensitive user data, consult with a legal professional._

## 1. Information We Process via Facebook API

Our automated Service interacts with the Facebook API primarily to [**CHOOSE AND EDIT AS APPLICABLE - BE ACCURATE!** Examples below]:

* **Post Content:** Send content (text, images, links) provided by us for publication on Facebook Pages managed by us.
* **Retrieve Page Data:** Access basic data or insights about Facebook Pages managed by us (e.g., post IDs, basic engagement counts) solely for operational purposes like confirming post success or basic performance monitoring.
* **Authentication Tokens:** Store access tokens securely within our automation platform (n8n) solely for the purpose of authenticating API requests to Facebook on our behalf.
* **[If applicable, add other data types like reading comments, user profile info - be very specific and ensure you have user consent if necessary]**

We **do not** knowingly collect or process sensitive personal information from Facebook users interacting with our managed Pages via this automated Service, unless explicitly stated otherwise and with appropriate consent mechanisms in place.

## 2. How We Use Information

The information processed via the Facebook API is used solely for the following purposes:

* To operate and maintain the automated Service (e.g., posting content, authenticating requests).
* [**EDIT/ADD as needed:** e.g., To monitor the performance of content posted via the Service.]

## 3. Data Storage and Security

* Content intended for posting may be processed transiently by the Service.
* Authentication tokens required to interact with the Facebook API are stored securely within the credential management features of our automation platform (n8n).
* We implement reasonable measures to protect the limited data we process but cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share personal information processed through this Service via the Facebook API with third parties, except as required by law or to operate the Service (e.g., the data naturally passes through the n8n platform and the Facebook API).

## 5. Your Choices [Optional - More relevant if reading user data]

[**Consider adding info here if you read user comments/data, e.g., how users can manage their data related to your page/app.** For simple posting bots, this might be less relevant.]
